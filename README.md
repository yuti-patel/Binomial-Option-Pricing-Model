# Binomial-Option-Pricing-Model
Binomial Option Pricing Model for American and European Options 

The binomial option pricing model uses an iterative procedure, allowing for the specification of nodes, or points in time, during the time span between the valuation date and the option's expiration date.With binomial option price models, the assumptions are that there are two possible outcomesâ€”hence, the binomial part of the model. With a pricing model, the two outcomes are a move up, or a move down.In contrast to the Black-Scholes model, which provides a numerical result based on inputs, the binomial model allows for the calculation of the asset and the option for multiple periods along with the range of possible results for each period.
